		<a href="#overview">Overview</a>
		<p>Playing fantasy wrestling is easy. If you’ve ever played fantasy football or any other fantasy sports game, you already know how it’s done.</p>
<p>You and your friends can create or join a promotion of up to 8 players. Each player builds a stable of male and female wrestlers and earns points based on the results of televised professional wrestling events. (For now, our game uses only WWE results, but we hope to expand to TNA, ROH, and possibly other offerings in the future.) At the end of a set number of weeks, the season comes to a close, and a champion of your promotion is crowned.</p>
		<div id="overview" class="content">
		The Professional Wrestling Fantasy Alliance (PWFA) is comprised of individual Promotions of two to eight players. Each player may manage one Stable in a Promotion and is responsible for guiding his or her own Stable to victory. Active participation, trading of performers, and promo-cutting are encouraged.
<p>The game is administered by the Chairman of the PWFA. Where these rules are insufficient, the Chairman has the authority to issue binding rulings and to declare final decisions on all disputes among players.</p>

<p><u>Season</u><br>
Before the Fantasy WWE game begins, the Chairman determines and announces the duration of the season. A season must begin the Monday after a pay-per-view event; a season must end with the conclusion of a pay-per-view event.
<p>The game is scored weekly, with each week of the season running from Monday through the completion of the airing of all original televised sports entertainment programming the following Sunday.
</div>

		<a href="#stable">Build Your Stable</a>
The season begins with a draft, where each player in turn selects a wrestler from the pool of remaining options. Each wrestler has been sorted into a specific classification (“Main Event,” “Mid Card,” “Diva,” etc.), and your stable can have a limited number of each type, so choose carefully and plan ahead!
		<div id="stable" class="content">
		Each player signs and manages a Stable of nine performers, attempting to anticipate which performers will earn the player the most points each week. Of the Stable's nine performers, seven may earn points for the player in a given week, while the other three await their turn in the Locker Room.

<p><u>Classification</u><br>
WWE performers compete on four regular weekly television shows (Monday Night RAW, WWE Main Event, Friday Night SmackDown, and WWE Superstars), at pay-per-view events that are held approximately once per month, and infrequently on other special occasions.
<p>In Fantasy WWE, each individual in-ring male performer ("Superstar") is classified by tier based on whether the superstar is being "booked" in the Main Event (ME), Mid-Card (MC), or Under-Card (UC).
<p>In-ring female performers ("Divas") are classified simply as Divas (DI).
<p>Each player decides which of his nine performers to place in seven active slots each week. The slots include: one reserved for performers classified as Main Event (ME), two for those in the Mid-Card (MC), one for those in the Under-Card (UC), one for a Diva (DI), and one slot that is unreserved and can be filled by a performer from any classification (FLEX). The three remaining performers under contract to the player remain in the Locker Room for the week and do not earn any points for the player.
<p>If a performer is injured, suspended, or otherwise inactive for at least 30 days, he or she will be considered "Inactive" and a corresponding notation will appear next to the performer's name. This designation serves only as a courtesy to the players. All "Inactive" performers are eligible for active and inactive Stable slots; may be signed, released, or traded; and may be drafted (see below).
<p>All performers not signed by a player are considered Free Agents and subsequently may be signed to a Stable pursuant to the Transactions rules outlined below.
<p>When a new performer is added to the WWE roster, the Chairman shall immediately classify the new performer and the performer becomes a restricted free agent, effective the following week (see Transactions below).

<p><u>Draft</u><br>
Stables are initially stocked via a draft similar to the draft held by most fantasy sports leagues. The draft consists of nine rounds in which each player has the opportunity to select one available performer per round until all nine of the player's Stable spots are filled. The player that selects last in each round of the draft will select first in the succeeding round. Initially, the order of selection for the first round of the draft is randomly assigned; see "Play it again!" below for subsequent seasons.
<p>Performers on the Inactive list are eligible to be drafted.

<p><u>Reclassification</u><br>
After each pay-per-view event, the Chairman may choose to reclassify Superstars and Divas to reflect the way they are currently being booked (i.e. move a UC superstar up to the MC tier). Without exception, world and women's champions and number-one contenders for those titles will be classified in the Main Event; mid-card champions and number-one contenders for those titles will be classified in the Mid-Card. As a courtesy to the other players, the Chairman should notify the entire PWFA as soon as he or she begins to consider reclassifying performers so players can begin to assess the transactions they may need to make.
<p>The Chairman shall not abuse this power to the benefit or detriment of any player. Reclassifications can be vetoed by a majority vote of all players.
</div>

		<a href="#scoring">Scoring</a>
Once the draft is finished, the competition begins. Whenever a wrestler in your stable wins a match on a televised wrestling card, you will earn points. The exact formula for calculating the points is explained below, but the guiding principle is that the bigger the match -- and the longer the odds -- the more points your wrestler will earn you. The good news is that the points will be calculated automatically for you, so you just need to understand how it works in order to strategize.
		<div id="scoring" class="content">
		Points are determined by using a Base Point Value and applying a series of modifiers, where applicable.

<p><u>Base Point Value</u><br>
The Base Point Value for a victory is calculated by multiplying the number of competitors in the match by 10, and dividing the result by the number of winners in the match, and again dividing that result by the numbers of winners in the match. In a basic singles match, two competitors wrestle and one is victorious: 2 x 10 = 20 / 1 = 20 / 1 = 20 base points.
<p>As the number of competitors and winners changes, the Base Point Value may change. For example, in a tag team match, four competitors wrestle and two are victorious: 4 x 10 = 40 / 2 = 20 / 2 = 10 base points for each victorious wrestler.
<p>In a Triple Threat Match: 3 x 10 = 30 / 1 = 30 / 1 = 30 base points for the winning wrestler.
<p>Multiple-fall matches, including Two-out-of-Three Fall, Royal Rumble, Elimination Chamber, and Survivor Series matches, are calculated on a different scale (see below).

<p><u>Decision Multiplier</u><br>
The Base Point Value is affected by the victory condition of the match by applying a Decision Multiplier.
<p>A victory by pinfall, submission, knockout, or referee stoppage is considered a “normal” win; the base point value is unaffected.<br>
Decision Multiplier = 1.0<br>
Example: John Cena def. Randy Orton by pinfall; John Cena’s point value so far is 20 points.

<p>A victory by countout, disqualification, or forfeit is considered a less worthy win; the base point value is cut in half.<br>
Decision Multiplier = 0.5<br>
Example: Randy Orton def. John Cena by countout; Randy Orton’s point value so far is 10 points.

<p>A victory in a match with a special stipulation (i.e. “No Holds Barred,” or “Last Man Standing”) is considered an exceptional win; the base point value is increased by 25%. A battle royal victory is included in this category.<br>
Decision Multiplier = 1.25<br>
Example: CM Punk def. Bray Wyatt by fulfilling the stipulation in a Steel Cage Match; CM Punk’s point value so far is 25 points.

<p>The Money in the Bank Ladder Match is is unique; because the match contains many other point multipliers and bonuses, the base point value for the winner of the match is decreased by 25%<br>
Decision Multiplier: 0.75<br>
Example: Randy Orton def. Rob Van Dam by grabbing the briefcase in the Money in the Bank Ladder Match; Randy Orton’s point value so far is 15 points.<br>
Note: Money in the Bank Ladder Matches have never involved fewer than five competitors, so the point total for the winner will be much higher than 15 points. For example, Randy Orton’s 2013 win would have been worth a total of 90 points.

<p><i>Multiple Fall Matches</i><br>
In a match with multiple falls (i.e. Two-out-of-Three Falls, Survivor Series Elimination), a wrestler earns points for each fall he or she scores. After applying the Decisions Modifier to the base point value, the wrestler earns 25% of that value for scoring a fall.<br>
Decision Multiplier: 0.25<br>
Example: Cody Rhodes eliminated Dean Ambrose by pinfall in a Survivor Series Elimination match; after applying the Decision Multiplier, Cody Rhodes’ point value so far is 5 points.

<p>Points are awarded for each fall, even if the wrestler does not ultimately win the match. The winner of the match is also awarded points for the match victory, using the Decision Multiplier as outlined in the previous section.<br>
Example: In a Two-out-of-Three Falls match: Ryback pinned John Cena to score a fall (10 points for Ryback); Ryback was counted out for a fall (5 points for John Cena); John Cena submitted Ryback to score a fall (10 points for John Cena); John Cena def. Ryback in the match (additional 20 points for John Cena, for a total of 35 points for John Cena and 10 points for Ryback)

<p><u>Pay-Per-View Matches</u><br>
Pay-per-view matches are worth double points. After the base point value has been calculated, and the Decision and Multiple Fall modifiers have been applied, the point value is doubled for a pay-per-view victory (i.e. 40 points for a basic singles match on pay-per-view).
<p>Matches on pay-per-view pre-shows count as regularly televised matches, not pay-per-view matches.

<p><u>Royal Rumble Match</u><br>
The Royal Rumble match is a type of match with its own set of rules.
<p>The overall winner of the Royal Rumble uses a Base Point Value of 25 points (in practical terms, this is 50 points because it is doubled by virtue of being a pay-per-view match). In the case of a tie, as in the 1994 Royal Rumble, the Base Point Value for the co-winners is half of 25, rounded to the nearest whole number, or 13 points.
<p>The winner(s) and all other wrestlers competing in the Royal Rumble match can earn additional points. A wrestler earns 10 points for every 10 minutes spent in the match (rounded to the nearest 10; e.g. 6 minutes, 37 seconds is worth 10 points). A wrestler also earns 10 points for every elimination he or she causes, in whole or in part. Note: Time and Elimination points are added after any pay-per-view doubling.

<p><u>Championships</u><br>
Winning a championship brings an additional bonus. This bonus is added after all other modifiers have been applied. The bonuses are:
<p>+60 points for winning the WWE World Heavyweight Championship<br>
+30 points for winning the Intercontinental Championship, United States Championship, or Divas Championship<br>
+25 points for winning the WWE Tag Team Championship
<p>Championship bonus points are not awarded for successful title defenses.

<p><u>Total points</u><br>
After all modifiers have been applied to the Base Point Value, the total points for a match are assigned to the appropriate participants in the match. Most of the time, this will be 20 points for a pinfall singles victory or 10 points for a pinfall tag team victory, but varying match circumstances can result in any conceivable number of points being awarded. You’re sure to get a feel for the scoring system as the game plays out.

<p><u>Other scoring rules</u><br>
Victories over performers not listed on the official WWE roster (i.e. "local competitors"), including WWE NXT performers, are worth half the points of a normal victory (i.e. 1 point for a pinfall/submission win, 0.5 points for a disqualification/count-out win).
<p>If a match is ruled a no contest, no points are awarded.
<p>The source for all match results is WWE.com. A player may petition the Chairman to overrule the official results posted on WWE.com if he or she feels the results are incorrect. If a majority of players supports the petition, the results will be amended.
<p>The Chairman will publish the results of each televised event and an updated scoreboard as soon as possible after the conclusion of each event. The Chairman will announce each week's winner and provide an updated standings table at the conclusion of each week.

		<a href="#transactions">Transactions</a>
Losing a match doesn’t hurt your point total -- but it doesn’t help either! Throughout the season, players are free to trade wrestlers, drop underperforming ones from their stables, or add free agents to improve their chances.
		<div id="transactions" class="content">
		All Stables are locked for the week Monday at 8 p.m. Eastern U.S. time. The Stable in place at that time is the Stable the player must use for the duration of that week.
<p>Players may drop performers from their Stable, add an unrestricted free agent to their Stable, place a claim on a restricted free agent, or trade performers with another player at any time. However, the results of those transactions are not in effect until the week following the transaction.

<p><u>Unrestricted Free Agents</u><br>
All performers that are not chosen in the draft at the start of the season become unrestricted free agents. Unrestricted free agents can be added by any player to his or her Stable on a first-come, first-serve basis. A player cannot have more than one performer in any Stable spot, so the player must vacate the appropriate Stable spot by dropping the performer in that Stable spot before he or she can add another in that Stable spot.

<p><u>Restricted Free Agents</u><br>
When a performer is dropped from a Stable, the performer becomes a restricted free agent.
<p>The restricted free agent is ineligible for use by any player for the week after the performer is dropped. During that week, all interested players may claim the restricted free agent in an attempt to add the restricted free agent to his or her Stable.
<p>At the conclusion of the week, the Chairman shall award the restricted free agent to the player with the worst overall winning percentage that placed a claim on the restricted free agent. If no claim is made on the restricted free agent, the performer becomes an unrestricted free agent and may be added by any player on a first-come, first-serve basis.

<p><u>Trades</u><br>
Players may trade performers between and among each other. Keep in mind that when a trade is complete, only one performer may occupy each slot in a player's Stable.
<p>Trading shall only be done with the intention of improving one's own team. To avoid foul play, the Chairman shall establish a trade deadline several weeks before the end of the season after which no further trades may take place. This is to prevent a player that is out of contention for the Fantasy WWE Championship from intentionally trading valuable performers to bolster another player's chances of victory.

		<a href="#winning">Winning the Game</a>
You’ll compete against the other players in your promotion each week, and the player with the highest point total will be awarded a win for that week. At the end of the season, the player with the most weekly wins is crowned the promotion champion!
		<div id="winning" class="content">
		At the end of the season, the player with the highest winning percentage is crowned Fantasy WWE Champion.
<p>If more than one player is tied for the highest winning percentage, the player that earned the most overall points throughout the season is awarded the Championship.
<p>If the players tied for the highest winning percentage also have the same number of overall points, they may fight in a steel cage to determine the Champion, or they may choose to be declared Co-Champions.

<p><u>Play it again!</u><br>
Upon the conclusion of a Fantasy WWE season, you may choose to keep your promotion active for another season. In subsequent drafts, the first-round-draft selection order corresponds inversely to the previous season's final standings, with the last place team selecting first.<p></p>
